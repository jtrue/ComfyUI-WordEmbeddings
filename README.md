# ComfyUI-WordEmbeddings

Custom nodes for exploring classic word-embedding spaces (e.g., GloVe, word2vec) inside **ComfyUI**. Load a model, inspect neighbors, do equation-style analogies, and project tokens onto semantic axes (1D/2D/3D) with human-readable summaries.

---

## Features at a glance

- **Axis (1D):** “`king` is more **man** than **woman`” + scalars
- **Axis2D / Axis3D:** Place any token in 2D/3D semantic space you define
- **Neighbors / Equation / Interpolation:** Classic embedding ops
- **Centrality:** How “typical/common” vs “distinctive/outlier” a token is in this embedding space
